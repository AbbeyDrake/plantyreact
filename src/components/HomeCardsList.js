        description: "Interacting with nature also helps our bodies heal. Researchers found that rooms with plants have less dust and mold than rooms without any foliage. Leaves and other parts  of the plants act as natural filters to catch allergens and other airborne particles. Common low-light houseplants like Chinese evergreen or the peace lily can do the job. Violets and other plants with textured leaves might be even better trappers"

Their use in  ceremonies and prayers enacts the power of the spiritual realm that elicits the Creator's intervention in healing. Plants remind us that Mother Earth, our first teacher, has provided us with the tools necessary to heal physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually."
